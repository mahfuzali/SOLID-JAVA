# SOLID Principles Java

This project demonstrate the adherence to S.O.L.I.D principles introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns"

### The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate things that change for different reasons.

### The Open Closed Principle (OCP)
A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

### The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface

### The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
